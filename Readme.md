# FLock Model Example Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of example implementations designed for the FLock.io model, a crucial component for clients within the FLock ecosystem seeking to leverage the power of federated learning. By providing a foundational framework, these models are instrumental in generating bounty tasks on the FLock testnet. This, in turn, enables participants to engage in collaborative efforts to fine-tune and enhance the models, fostering innovation and improvement within the federated learning domain. 

The integration of these models into the testnet not only accelerates the development of more refined and efficient solutions but also promotes a community-driven approach to solving complex problems in federated learning.
